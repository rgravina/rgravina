## Welcome 

This is my Github profile, where you can see the open source projects I've been working on. This also serves as a short intro to what I've been working on recently.

### Recent Work

#### Extreme Programming

While most of the work I do at [Pivotal Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs) is not available publically on Github, I can share a talk I co-presented in September 2020 about the VMware Pivotal Labs take on Extreme Programming. It includes some question and answer time with great questions from the audience so you might like to learn a little about the work I do there.

#### Language Learning Applications

Together with [@immenor](https://github.com/immenor) and [@wrightak](https://github.com/wrightak), I work on [Tako Words](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tako-words/id966420453), an iOS application designed help you learn a new langauge. We're focussed on Japanese and English for now, but hope to add dictionaries for other languages in the future. Tako is much more than a dictionaty app though - it unique among language learning apps because it is focussed around the words sentences you enter yourself. It generates flashcards from these and schedules them with the Supermemo algorithm, with an easy to use iPhone and watchOS interface.
