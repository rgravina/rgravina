## Welcome 

I'm a Senior Software Engineer currently working at [VMware Pivotal Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs) in Tokyo, Japan! Most of the work I do is for clients and closed source, however I do contribute to open source projects when I can, and work on a significant side project which you can read about below. 

### Recent Work

#### Extreme Programming

While most of the work I do at VMware Pivotal Labs is not available on Github, I can share a talk I co-presented in September 2020 about how we practice Extreme Programming.

#### Language Learning Applications

Together with [@immenor](https://github.com/immenor) and [@wrightak](https://github.com/wrightak), I work on a language learning iPhone, Apple Watch and iPad app called [Tako Words](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tako-words/id966420453). We've designed it with the needs of intermediate learners immersed in the foreign language in mind. You enter sentences you read or hear, and study words that appear in them in context. We use the app daily and have users that do the same. It's a free app, so try it out and let us know what you think.

### Other Work

#### Open Source Projects

I have made some small contributions to [Succint](https://github.com/derekleerock/Succinct), an open source iOS testing library created by [@derekleerock](https://github.com/derekleerock/) which we use in Tako to write fast and decoupled view controller tests. I also made small improvements to [adarkroom](https://github.com/rgravina/adarkroom), a Javascript text adventure game.

#### Programming Languages and Compilers

Programming langauges, compilers and interpreters have always been an interest of mine. I enjoyed working through "Writing an Interpreter in Go" and updated the [Monkey](https://github.com/rgravina/monkey) interpreter as I went through, as well as the [Jack compiler](https://github.com/rgravina/nand2tetris) from "The Elements of Computing Systems"(https://www.nand2tetris.org).
