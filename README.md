## Welcome 

I'm a Senior Software Engineer currently working at [VMware Pivotal Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs). Most of the work I do is for clients and is closed source, however I do contribute to open source projects when I can, and work on a significant side project which you can read about below. 

### Recent Work

#### Extreme Programming

While most of the work I do at VMware Pivotal Labs is not available on Github, I can share a talk I co-presented in September 2020 about how we practice Extreme Programming.

#### Apps on the App Store

Together with [@immenor](https://github.com/immenor) and others I work on a language learning iPhone, Apple Watch and iPad app called [Tako Words](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tako-words/id966420453). We've designed it with the needs of intermediate learners in mind, while keeping it accessable for beginners. We use the app daily and have users that do the same. It's a free app, so try it out and let us know what you think.

#### Mentoring

While [Matt](https://github.com/mp40) was a student at the programming boot camp [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io), we met for regular mentoring sessions. We used a lot of the Extreme Programming practices - pair programming and test driven development - to help solidify the material he was learning. He's now a professional developer. I've also partiicpated in workshops and Q&A sessions with Code Chrysalis, and proud of the work they do and what their students are achieving after graduating.

#### Women Who Code

I have also contributed to the [Women Who Code Tokyo iOS App](https://github.com/WWCodeTokyo/wwcode-tokyo-iOS-app), and support the important work they and others are doing to increase diversity in the software industry.

### Other Work

#### Open Source Projects

I have made some small contributions to [Succint](https://github.com/derekleerock/Succinct), an open source iOS testing library created by [@derekleerock](https://github.com/derekleerock/). It's great for writing fast, decoupled view controller tests that don't need to be run with XCUITest. I also made small improvements to [A Dark Room](https://github.com/rgravina/adarkroom), a Javascript text adventure game.

#### Programming Languages and Compilers

Programming langauges, compilers and interpreters have always been an interest of mine. I have enjoyed working through ["Writing an Interpreter in Go"](https://interpreterbook.com), resulting in a completed [Monkey interpreter](https://github.com/rgravina/monkey). I have also implemented my own [Jack compiler](https://github.com/rgravina/nand2tetris) in Swift using the book ["The Elements of Computing Systems"](https://www.nand2tetris.org).
