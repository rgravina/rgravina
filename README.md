Hello! This is my Github profile, where you can see all of the publicially available projects I've been working on. 

### Recent Work

#### Extreme Programming

While most of the work I do at @pivotal is not available publically on Github, I can share a talk I co-presented in September 2020 about the VMware Pivotal Labs take on Extreme Programming. It includes some question and answer time with great questions from the audience so you might like to learn a little about the work I do there.

#### Language Learning Apps

Together with @immenor and @wrightak I work on ![Tako Words](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tako-words/id966420453), an iOS application to help you learn a new langauge. We're focussed on Japanese and English for now, but hope to add dictionaries for other languages in the future. Tako is unique among language learning apps in that it's focussed around the example sentences you enter yourself. It generates flashcard and schedules them with the Supermemo algorithm.
