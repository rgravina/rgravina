## Welcome 

This is my Github profile, where you can see the open source projects I've been working on. This also serves as a short intro to what I've been working on recently.

### Recent Work

#### Extreme Programming

While most of the work I do at [VMware Pivotal Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs) is not available publically on Github, I can share a talk I co-presented in September 2020 about how we practice Extreme Programming at VMware Pivotal Labs. It's a short 20 minute talk with some time at the end reserved for questions and a retrospective.

#### Language Learning Applications

Together with [@immenor](https://github.com/immenor) and [@wrightak](https://github.com/wrightak), I work on [Tako Words](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tako-words/id966420453), an iOS application designed help you learn a new langauge. We're focussed on Japanese and English for now, but hope to add dictionaries for other languages in the future. Tako is much more than a dictionaty app though - it's unique among language learning apps because it is focussed around the words sentences you enter yourself. Your experiences with the langauge. It generates flashcards from your content and schedules them using the Supermemo algorithm, all with an easy to use iPhone and watchOS interface.
