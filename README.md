## Welcome 

I'm a Senior Software Engineer currently working at [VMware Pivotal Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs). Most of the work I do is for clients and is closed source, however I do contribute to open source projects when I can, and work on a significant side project which you can read about below. 

### Recent Work

#### Extreme Programming

While most of the work I do at VMware Pivotal Labs is not available on Github, I can share a talk I co-presented in September 2020 about how we practice Extreme Programming.

#### Language Learning Applications

Together with [@immenor](https://github.com/immenor) and [@wrightak](https://github.com/wrightak), I work on a language learning iPhone, Apple Watch and iPad app called [Tako Words](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tako-words/id966420453). We've designed it with the needs of intermediate learners in mind, while keeping it accessable for beginners. We use the app daily and have users that do the same. It's a free app, so try it out and let us know what you think.

### Other Work

#### Open Source Projects

I have made some small contributions to [Succint](https://github.com/derekleerock/Succinct), an open source iOS testing library created by [@derekleerock](https://github.com/derekleerock/). It's great for writing fast, decoupled view controller tests that don't need to be run with XCUITest. I also made small improvements to [A Dark Room](https://github.com/rgravina/adarkroom), a Javascript text adventure game.

#### Programming Languages and Compilers

Programming langauges, compilers and interpreters have always been an interest of mine. I have enjoyed working through "Writing an Interpreter in Go", working through the code in the book and resulting in a completed [Monkey interpreter](https://github.com/rgravina/monkey). I have also implemented my own [Jack compiler](https://github.com/rgravina/nand2tetris) in Swift, using the book ["The Elements of Computing Systems"](https://www.nand2tetris.org).
